  </span>&quot;I just wanted to write and thank you SO much for making a free guides such as yours available on the internet.  I am trying to review all elements of Excel before taking an employment assessment test.  I haven't used Excel in years and needed a major refresher course in a very short amount of time and your guides gave me just that in a very easy format. I feel more confident in taking the test now. Thank you!!&quot;</p>

    &quot;I have wanted to upgrade my excel skill for years but I always avoided VBA because it seemed too much like hard-core programming and I am not a programmer. I looked at a lot of other online guidess before running across Excel-Easy, but none offered practical help or easy, straight forward instruction. Advanced Excel for Data Analysis made learning VBA genuinely easy and I was able to put what I learned to immediate use. The lessons are practical and easy to understand yet comprehensive. The library of examples provide useful practice and lots of ready-to-go solutions. Great job guys!&quot;</p>

    &quot;I have a fair amount of experience with Excel but had never created a Userform or worked with the associated VBA Code. Through the Advanced Excel website, I was able to quickly find examples on how to create Input Boxes, work with Multiple Listbox Selections, and how to transfer data from a Userform back to a worksheet. In addition, for a more complex question I had, Advanced Excel responded to my email within 24 hours. I highly recommend this site for anyone new to Userforms and working with VBA code.&quot;</p>

    &quot;The way the site is structured is ideal for my needs as I can gradually find out the information I need in a logical step-by-step way, and the various 
cross-references are also well-structured. I particularly like the accompanying screenshots on the various sections on the site as they add useful context to the textual info/instructions being given and as a complete beginner to Excel VBA and the Visual Basic Editor that is invaluable at times.&quot;</p>

    &quot;I stumbled on Advanced Excel through a Google search. Am I glad I did! I've been trying to learn Visual Basic for a project I have been working on, and needed to get help ASAP. Many websites promise help and support, but the folks at Advanced Excel really gave me the individual attention I needed to move my project along. The response time to my questions was less than 24 hours, which was great. And did I mention the many examples of codes they already have on the website? If you are a Visual Basic beginner, and need to get help fast, you've come to the right place.&quot;</p>

    &quot;As a teacher with over 34 years of experience, I know all too well, the time and commitment it takes to produce quality lessons like the ones you have created. You are to be commended for the generous work you produce and for educating so many around the world. I teach Excel to middle school students, many of whom do not appreciate the program until years later when they write back in appreciation of being introduced to it. I will be certain to direct them to your site in the future. Once again, all of you deserve a huge note of gratitude. You are an amazing group!&quot;</p>

    &quot;Spot on! That was exactly what I was wanting the 'concept' to do. Very impressed with quick response and also the information provided, truly a great service for 'us beginners'. I know there is a wealth of VBA information out there and to be honest, it becomes mind-bending trying to get what you want out of it together! Having a little help along the way goes much further in enabling oneself to improve, a case of 'lead by example' shall we say.&quot;</p>
